Given a number n, Write a program that generates and prints all binary numbers with decimal values from 1 to n.

        Input:

        The first line of input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases.
        The first line of each test case is N.

        Output:

        Print all binary numbers with decimal values from 1 to n in a single line.

        Constraints:

        1 ≤ T ≤ 100
        1 ≤ N ≤ 500

        Example:

        Input
        2
        2
        5

        Output
